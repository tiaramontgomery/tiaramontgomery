          Style-it is a clothing app designed to help users create new outfits
          from existing clothes in their closet. The app has several features
          that allow users to take photos and save their clothing in a catalog
          to be styled in various ways, and a try-on feature to simulate the
          outfit on themselves.

          This is my very first UI/UX design project I completed for a class. We
          were given complete freedom to identify a problem and brainstorm a
          solution. It can be difficult to find and style outfits in a closet
          full of clothes. So, I attempted to design an application to combat
          this issue. Reflecting back on this project, I would focus more on
          improving the UI and refining this idea.
