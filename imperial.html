          I joined the Imperial Supplies UX team Summer 2024 as a UX intern. I
          worked on projects ranging from researching competitors, analyzing
          consumer base, and re-designing tools. Each project challenged me to
          think critically and creatively, enhancing my problem-solving skills
          and expanding my understanding of user-centered design principles.

              <h3>
                The Voice of Customer (VoC) program at Imperial Supplies is
                still in its early stages, focusing on acting upon customer
                feedback to effectively close the feedback loop. A significant
                portion of feedback received through this program pertains to
                Dedicated Account Advisors (DAAs). Recognizing the value of
                these insights, my team identified the importance of sharing
                this information with the sales department. I was responsible
                for analyzing the feedback, structuring it into a clear and
                accessible format, and facilitating the collection of responses
                from the sales team.
